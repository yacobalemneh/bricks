# Clean Architecture Flutter Project with go_router and BLoC

This repository provides a set of bricks that enable you to create and manage a Flutter project with clean architecture, `go_router` for navigation, and `BLoC` for state management. The bricks included in this repository are:

- `clean_router_project`: Sets up a clean and organized Flutter project with `go_router`, feature-based route management, and flavor configurations.
- `clean_bloc_feature`: Helps you create new features and their initial screens in the `lib/features/` directory.
- `clean_bloc_route`: Generates new screens with `BLoC` or `Cubit` state management and automatically updates the corresponding feature's `routes.dart` file with the new screen's route.

By using these bricks, you can quickly set up a maintainable and scalable Flutter project with clean architecture, feature-based navigation, and state management using `BLoC` or `Cubit`. Each brick is designed to work seamlessly with the others, ensuring a smooth development experience.
